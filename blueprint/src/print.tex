% This file makes a printable version of the blueprint
% It should include all the \usepackage needed for the pdf version.
% The template version assume you want to use a modern TeX compiler
% such as xeLaTeX or luaLaTeX including support for unicode
% and Latin Modern Math font with standard bugfixes applied.
% It also uses expl3 in order to support macros related to the dependency graph.
% It also includes standard AMS packages (and their improved version
% mathtools) as well as support for links with a sober decoration
% (no ugly rectangles around links).
% It is otherwise a very minimal preamble (you should probably at least
% add cleveref and tikz-cd).

\begin{abstract}
    This paper serves as the blueprint for the project aimed at formalising Fermat’s Last Theorem for
    the exponent 3 adopting the Lean 4 interactive proof assistant. It provides detailed coverage of
    all necessary definitions, theorems, and proofs, presented in natural, informal language to facilitate
    understanding and implementation.
